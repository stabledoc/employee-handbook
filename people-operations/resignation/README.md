# Resignation

A notice period of one month alongside resignation letter ahead of the resignation date should be submitted to HR. Proper handling over of company's property and documents should take place not later than a week to the said date. 
In case of emergencies exit, an employee is expected to hand over all property of the organisation to his/her team lead within a week and ensure they are cleared by the administrative department before leaving.
