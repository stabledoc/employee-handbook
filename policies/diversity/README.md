# Diversity, Inclusion and Equality Policy


## Introduction

This policies help us maintain a free, fair and credible working environment that allows people of different background contribute meaningfully to the development of our products and services. 

## TL;DR

Currently, we have an all-male developer team. Going forward, this might change. We promote a diverse, inclusive and equal workplace. Every employee is expected to treat everyone with whom they have contact with, with dignity, courtesy and respect. We hire, promote and reward our employees based on their capabilities and skills. Gender, race, colour, ethnic or national origins, marital status, family circumstances, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, political or religious belief are not relevant to personal and team performance at work.
