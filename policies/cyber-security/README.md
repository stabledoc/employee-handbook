# Cybersecurity policy

## Introduction

This policy helps us address the issue of security on the cyberspace. At StableDoc, we are strong on data protection and privacy, hence we have strict rules laid down to prevent data breaches of any kind on the cyberspace. All our employees must conform to these guidelines to prevent compromising data to hackers.

## TL;DR

As mentioned in the introduction, new employees sometimes introduce risks and vulnerabilities into the company database, often unintentionally.

AÂ cybersecurity policy is to help equip with the knowledge needed to help reduce the risks introduced by human error.
Two-factor verification, locking of laptop screen, and other necessary password check-in are advised to be employed.
Common issues such as phishing attacks, insufficient password security, and poor access controls around sensitive information of clients and company information should be duly avoided.
